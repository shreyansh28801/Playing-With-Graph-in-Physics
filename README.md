# Playing with Graph in Physics

This project aims to explore and visualize various concepts and laws in physics using graphs. The project covers four topics: kinematics, modern physics, thermodynamics, and gravitational field. For each topic, the project uses Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to plot different types of graphs based on data from equations, arrays, or csv files. The project also allows the user to choose different methods to handle missing values in the csv files, such as mean, median, or mode. The project provides documentation for each graph, explaining the purpose, data source, and analysis of the graph. The user can also submit their own analysis during observation in the documentation.

## Python Concepts

This project aims to demonstrate the use of some Python concepts, such as object-oriented programming, file handling, and menu-driven input. The project uses these concepts to make the code more clear and accessible, and to allow the user to give input and choose which graph they want to see. The project also uses file handling to read text files that have important details of the graphs. The project provides documentation for each concept, explaining the purpose, syntax, and examples of the concept.

## How to run the project

The project files can be executed by running the main_file.py script. This script will display a menu with four options: kinematics, modern physics, thermodynamics, and gravitational field. The user can choose one of these options by entering the corresponding number. Then, the script will display another menu with different graphs related to the chosen topic. The user can choose one of these graphs by entering the corresponding number. The script will then plot the graph using Matplotlib and show it on the screen. The script will also display a documentation file for the chosen graph in a text editor. The user can read the documentation and enter their own analysis in the space provided. The user can save and close the documentation file when they are done. The script will then ask the user if they want to see another graph or exit the program.
