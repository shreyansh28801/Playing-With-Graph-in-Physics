The acceleration time graph is the graph that is used to determine the change in velocity in the given interval of the time. In the acceleration vs time graph on the x-axis you have the time taken by the object and on the y-axis acceleration of the object, in which the area under the graph gives you the change in velocity of the object over the given period of the time. The acceleration time graph is used to find the change in the velocity of the moving object for the given period of time and this can be determined by finding the area under the curve.
That's it ....
